The ka9q-radio package is primarily designed for Debian Linux,
including the Raspbian variant for the Raspberry Pi.

Most of the programs will also build and run on Mac OSX,
mainly because I have a MacBook Pro as my primary desktop.

The ka9q-radio package has several package dependencies beyond those
usually needed to compile C programs (e.g., make, gcc).

On Raspbian, Debian or Ubuntu Linux, run the following command (as root):

apt install libfftw3-dev libbsd-dev libopus-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libasound2-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libattr1-dev portaudio19-dev libhackrf-dev

Some versions of Ubuntu have an older version of libfftw3-dev that lacks full
thread safety. The symptom here is the missing link-time symbol

       fftwf_make_planner_thread_safe()

If necessary, you can install and build it from the upstream source at

   http://www.fftw.org/fftw-3.3.7.tar.gz

(Thanks PY2SDR)

On Mac OSX, you'll need Apple's Xcode developer package with the command
line tools and the third-party 'macports' package, https://www.macports.org.

Then run, as root:

port install fftw-3 libopus portaudio hackrf-devel hackrf ncurses

I haven't set up virgin systems to test the installs so I could easily have missed something. If so, please let me know.
