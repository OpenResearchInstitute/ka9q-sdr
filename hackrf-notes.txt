Si5351C (U19) clock generator usage

channel 0 GCK1 - MAX5864 A/D sampling clock 12.288 MHz
channel 1 GCK2 p28 pin 13 (unused?)
channel 2  (unused?) SGPIO clock
channel 3 10 MHz - clock output connector
channel 4 50 MHz MIX_CLK
channel 5 40 MHz - MAX2837 transceiver
channel 6 3.1372549534 MHz
channel 7 40 MHz - MCU Clock


IF frequency must be between 2,150 MHz and 2,750 MHz inclusive

If filter is not bypassed, LO must be between 84.375000 MHz and  5400.000000 MHz inclusive
